To-do
1. Use 2D-vector (or vector with nested queue/priority queue)
    - Column: size/associativity
    - Row: 16 (store address in a set of 16)
2. If miss
    - replace: LRU(Last recently used)
               FIFO (First in first out)
3. If hit
    - store the hit times so we can compute the hit rate later
4. Input will be a bunch of addresses
    - Need to read in line by line
    - Need to store them into cache at the same time (do we make several differnet vector or do it one by one?)
    - Need to do replacement and keep track of hit rate
